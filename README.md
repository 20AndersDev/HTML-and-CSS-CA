# Project Title

HTML-and-CSS-CA

## Description

This is my finished product for the forst year front end development HTML and CSS course assignment.
The HTML and CSS CA was about making a website from the prototype we made from the design 1 course assignment. I picked brief 2, the "SquareEyes" task.

The HTML and CSS website is also published to netlify: https://sprightly-gelato-a3a4ee.netlify.app/

Note that for a better experience for mobile and tablet users, i made it so the movie sections is swipeable by making the sections overflow off the screen. For desktop users all the movies are available on the screen without the need for horizontal scroll.
